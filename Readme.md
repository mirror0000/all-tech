## Artificial Intelligence learning with Python

### What is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a way to make machines think and behave intelligently. These
machines are controlled by software inside them, so AI has a lot to do with intelligent
software programs that control these machines. It is a science of finding theories and
methodologies that can help machines understand the world and accordingly react to
situations in the same way that humans do.

### Branches of AI

* **Machine learning and pattern recognition** : This is perhaps the most popular
  form of AI out there. We design and develop software that can learn from data.
  Based on these learning models, we perform predictions on unknown data. One
  of the main constraints here is that these programs are limited to the power of the
  data. If the dataset is small, then the learning models would be limited as well.
* **Logic-based AI** : Mathematical logic is used to execute computer programs in
  logic-based AI. A program written in logic-based AI is basically a set of
  statements in logical form that express facts and rules about a particular problem
  domain. This is used extensively in pattern matching, language parsing, semantic
  analysis, and so on.
* **Search** : The Search techniques are used extensively in AI programs. These
  programs examine a large number of possibilities and then pick the most optimal
  path. For example, this is used a lot in strategy games such as Chess, networking,
  resource allocation, scheduling, and so on.
* **Knowledge representation** : The facts about the world around us need to be
  represented in some way for a system to make sense of them. The languages of
  mathematical logic are frequently used here. If knowledge is represented
  efficiently, systems can be smarter and more intelligent.
